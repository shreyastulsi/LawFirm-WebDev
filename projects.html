            <h2>Homeless Prevention</h2>
            <p>Studies show that Los Angeles is the most unaffordable city in the United States and ranks in the top fifteen most expensive cities in the world. It comes as no surprise that we also have the second largest population of homeless people in the United States. In fact, one in twenty-seven Angelenos are homeless. The Tenants Law Firm prevents homelessness in Los Angeles by helping tenants fight evictions and maintain their affordable housing status. Our Homelessness Prevention project protects tenants and holds landlords accountable for their actions.</p>

                    The Tenants Law Firm helps tenants who have been served with eviction notices, Unlawful Detainers, and three-day notices. We also help individuals who fear that they may be at risk of an eviction based on statements or threats made by their landlords.
